PInvoke is a managed wrapper library for the most widely used Win32 API calls. PInvoke eliminates all the difficulties of handling PInvoke signatures during coding. You just have to make a reference of that library like normal .Net library in your project and you are ready to go. You can then call the Win32 API like a normal method call. Most of all the good thing is that you don't have to remember all the constants required for the PInvoke call, this library will take care of this. All the unions, structures are elegantly handled by the library itself. You don't have to worry about it at all. Plus it comes with elaborate documentations which makes it easy to use like never before.


This project is currently in alpha stage and hosted at Google Code. To browse the source code please click here.

NOTE : As thousands of Win32 API calls are there, it is not possible for me to test each and every methods of it. Here is my one humble request, if you find any bug or malfunctioning or any sort of discrepancies please do lodge a bug report here positively. It will help others as well as you in future.

Interested developer can also send me a request to join this project.
